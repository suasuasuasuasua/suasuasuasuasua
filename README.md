# Hi There!

## Who am I?

My name is Justin Hoang, and this here is my Github! I'm excited to show the projects that I have worked on in the past.

## Where is Everything?

So far, I've been compiling my school work, but those repositories are private, for *obvious* reasons; nevertheless, I've learned a lot by using Git on my own.

I've worked on Code Academy and FreeCodeCamp, but those repositories are dedicated to what I would call *coding mechanics*, so things that wouldn't necessarily count as projects.

I've been try to work on more Python books, but I've been busy with school and my personal life.

I don't have an e-portfolio just yet, as I'm trying to find time/sanity for that. 

I'm not the biggest fan of web development, but building a beautiful website is definitely on my roadmap.
