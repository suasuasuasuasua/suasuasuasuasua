# Hi There!

## Who am I?

My name is Justin Hoang, and this here is my Github! I'm excited to show the projects that I have worked on in the past.

## Where is Everything?

So far, I've been compiling my school work, but those repositories are private, for *obvious* reasons; nevertheless, I've learned a lot by using Git on my own.

I've worked on Code Academy and FreeCodeCamp, but those repositories are dedicated to what I would call *coding mechanics*, so things that wouldn't necessarily count as projects.

I've been try to work on more Python books, but I've been busy with school and my personal life.

One thing that I'm very proud of is my [Vim-Config](https://github.com/suasuasuasuasua/Vim-Config) repository. Over the Summer (of 2021), I decided to learn Vim out of boredom and partly because of its notoriety. I also remember seeing one of my group mates using Vim; he was fluid with his fingers, knew every command, made zero mistakes. At that point I knew I had to try it.

I will be honest, I wanted to quit Vim on day one. It was horrible; the key bindings made no sense, the TUI was terrible for my eyes, I was grindingly slow, etc. 

Nevertheless, I kept on going because I knew that I would be taking a Linux course the following semester. I would have to learn Vim or Emacs either way, so I got a huge headstart. 

Since the start of Summer, I've been practicing Vim almost everyday by coding my own projects and schoolwork. In this repository, you can have a look at all of the configurations that I have compiled since then. It is still pretty basic (in comparison with veteran Vim users), but I'm proud of it and I don't need much more than this.

Now I just can't live without Vim.
