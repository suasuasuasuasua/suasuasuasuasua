# Hi There!

## Who am I?

My name is Justin Hoang, and this is my Github account.

## Where is Everything?

So far, I've been compiling my school work, but those repositories are private, for *obvious* reasons; nevertheless, I've learned a lot by programming and using Git on my own.

Check out the [compsci-tips](https://github.com/suasuasuasuasua/compsci-tips) repo though.

I don't have an e-portfolio just yet, as I'm trying to find time/sanity for that. 

However, I am working on the Odin Project on the side to dip my feet in web development.
